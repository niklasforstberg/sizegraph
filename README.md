# File Size Visualizer

A Python application that creates a visual representation of file and directory sizes, similar to WinDirStat. The visualization uses a treemap layout where the size of each rectangle is proportional to the file size, and the color indicates the file type.

## Features

- Visual representation of file and directory sizes using treemap layout
- Color coding by file type
- Interactive: click on any file/directory to see detailed information
- Progress indicator during directory scanning
- Handles large directory structures
- Shows file names for larger items

## File Type Colors

- ðŸ”´ Red: Image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif)
- ðŸ”µ Blue: Documents (.pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .md)
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Code files (.py, .js, .html, .css)
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Archives (.zip, .rar, .gz, .7z, .tar)
- ðŸŸ£ Purple: Media files (.mp3, .mp4, .avi, .mov)
- ï¿½cyan Cyan: System files (.exe, .dll, .sys)
- âš« Gray: Directories and unknown file types

- Python 3.6+
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)
